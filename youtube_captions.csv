00:00,hey what's up john sonmez from
00:01,simpleprogrammer.com
00:03,so I got this question from Caden about
00:06,how much am i worth as a software
00:10,developer that this was good he says
00:12,here he says hey John new topic for
00:13,simple programmer to possibly take a
00:15,look at maybe I should probably do a
00:16,blog post well this actually but that
00:18,would give a little bit more details but
00:19,I'll try to cover it here in a little
00:20,bit here he says it's hard for me as a
00:23,student to judge how much my skills are
00:25,worth in the industry because I haven't
00:27,worked in the industry yet I'm curious
00:29,if you could break down what kind of
00:30,salary ranges software intern should be
00:33,expected to be paid and what kind of
00:34,range of software engineer is fresh out
00:36,of college should be paid I wouldn't
00:37,want to go into an interview with
00:39,misleading expectations have them ask me
00:42,what kind of salary I'm comfortable with
00:43,and end up way over shooting or under
00:45,shooting after I've been in the industry
00:47,for a while I'm sure this would clear
00:48,out but it seems a bit hard to job with
00:52,no actual industry experience maybe you
00:54,could also cover a few good things to
00:55,know that could actually make students
00:57,more of an asset a company and more
00:59,excited to start them off at higher
01:01,salaries Thanks so I'm actually not
01:05,going to answer the second question and
01:06,this one because a lot of my videos talk
01:09,about that so I think you could probably
01:11,I've got a lot of videos in college you
01:13,might want to check those out in likes
01:16,are starting out as a software developer
01:17,those will probably answer that question
01:19,but I don't think I've really talked too
01:21,much about salary ranges I think of the
01:23,few videos I can't think of them now but
01:26,talking about particular salaries but so
01:29,I'm going to try and cover this topic
01:31,although there's some caveats here the
01:34,first caveat is this I'm going to tell
01:36,you what I think perhaps salary ranges
01:40,might or should be for developers in the
01:44,United States of America that are not in
01:47,cities like San Francisco or New York
01:50,right that are in just like general this
01:54,is a very generalized and you'll have to
01:55,adjust it for for kind of California and
01:58,New York and financial industry maybe
01:59,some Chicago type of salary if you're in
02:02,the financial industry for your quant
02:03,if you're involved in that it's gonna be
02:05,totally different if you're in
02:07,Facebook's and startups and Silicon
02:09,Valley it's gonna be totally different
02:10,so then the second caveat is
02:12,this what I'm telling you is bullshit
02:14,because you shouldn't really listen to
02:17,this this is just like a very very basic
02:18,guideline I don't know what I'm talking
02:21,about because it there are so many
02:23,outliers and you and part of like if
02:26,you're watching these videos if you're
02:27,going a simple programmer if you bought
02:29,how to market yourself as a software
02:30,developer especially if you've bought
02:32,that course then you know that the whole
02:35,point is to be an outlier is to to not
02:38,be not not be the traditional developer
02:42,that's stuck at the traditional rate
02:44,salary range but I'm going to kind of
02:46,break down what is the traditional one
02:47,and then maybe I'll if I still have some
02:49,time talk a little bit about breaking
02:51,out of that and why that that's actually
02:53,bullshit so let's talk about interns
02:55,first so what should an intern be paid
02:59,hmm that's a good question it could be
03:02,zero right that's that's valid for an
03:04,internship I think especially when
03:07,you're getting a good opportunity I if I
03:10,were just starting out I know it's tough
03:11,to break into the industry especially if
03:14,it's a good company as an intern I would
03:16,be willing to accept zero
03:17,honestly I don't I don't think there's
03:20,any problem with not getting paid when
03:22,you're learning a skill in getting an in
03:24,if you know for example I just have this
03:26,conversation with a friend of mine and
03:28,we were like yeah if a billionaire was
03:31,like dude you can I'm going to teach you
03:33,everything I know
03:34,I'm like oh you don't have to pay me
03:35,anything and I'm going to set up a tent
03:37,in your yard right and I would do your
03:40,dishes right like it's valuable
03:43,experiences is worth something so there
03:46,there's that could be zero but in
03:48,general I would expect a range again the
03:51,United States
03:52,you know caveat supply between somewhere
03:54,between forty to sixty thousand for for
03:58,an internship for most companies I think
04:00,that if you can pay less than that then
04:03,you probably shouldn't be getting paid
04:04,anything at all or the lies you're
04:05,getting taken advantage of which sounds
04:08,kind of weird but if you think about it
04:09,it makes sense okay now let's talk about
04:11,like a junior like beginning dev
04:13,position which I've I've talked about I
04:16,don't ever remember the video episode
04:18,now but there's maybe Rodrigo remembers
04:20,video if not nothing will appear here
04:22,except my finger but I did I did some
04:25,video talking about how you should not
04:29,enter as an entry-level software
04:31,developer don't even do that just like
04:33,go straight to regular dev or senior dev
04:35,that jr. is sort of a way to get ripped
04:38,off but if you do get into a junior
04:40,position I would say that you're
04:42,probably starting at a minimum of around
04:44,sixty thousand I know that there's some
04:46,that are fifty but I'd be aiming for
04:48,sixty I think that's a pretty reasonable
04:49,salary expectation in most of the u.s.
04:51,again big caveat here prices vary but
04:55,I'm giving sort of a general so I would
04:57,say maybe like the sixty to eighty range
04:58,whereas when you get up to the age range
05:00,that's probably more of a like a
05:02,mid-level dev or possibly like a low
05:05,level on a senior dev right position and
05:08,then from there you know I think 80 to
05:11,100 is probably like mid level developer
05:14,sort of sort of getting into the senior
05:17,probably some seniors are in there and
05:19,then like above you know when you're in
05:21,the six figure and you're not in Silicon
05:23,Valley you're not in New York City you
05:24,probably know your shit you probably are
05:26,have you know five to ten years
05:28,experience or you're really good you
05:30,have a really good specialty and you've
05:33,got at least some amount of notoriety
05:35,some people know who you are you you've
05:37,spoken out some of it you've got some
05:39,kind of credibility that's going to back
05:41,the fact that you're making more than
05:42,100k and that could go up to you know
05:44,100 120 game
05:46,now it gets serves to get interesting
05:48,from there because there's definitely
05:50,developers that make a lot more than 120
05:52,K and a lot a not all of them are in
05:54,Silicon Valley or New York City if
05:56,you're really good and you have a really
05:58,good specialty right and I'm we're
06:00,talking salaries here you can definitely
06:03,book something from the 120 to 200 range
06:07,I think that is especially if you're in
06:09,a senior position where you're going to
06:10,be overseeing a lot of other developers
06:12,you're going to be a technical lead or
06:13,architect that is highly possible
06:15,without that now Silicon Valley New York
06:18,City we could be going way way above
06:20,that range and if you're doing some of
06:23,the things that I'm talking about again
06:24,I'm going to plug my course because this
06:26,is relevant in this case how to market
06:27,yourself a software developer if you've
06:29,got your blog
06:30,if you're talking at event if you've
06:32,written a book if you've you know done
06:34,some of these things if you have a
06:35,podcast that's popular you've been on a
06:37,lot of podcast your name is somewhat
06:39,known now you're looking at like I would
06:42,not be accepting any jobs if you've got
06:45,that level of or in a decent level of
06:48,Neriah tea under 180 K I'd be like 180 K
06:52,I'll be shooting for 200 maybe 250
06:54,because people will pay that for that
06:57,this is now you're shooting for
06:58,Microsoft's and Google's and apples and
07:00,they're going to pay for your name and
07:02,they're going to pay you those ranges
07:04,you know you could definitely get those
07:06,ranges that and that's why guys that's
07:08,why when you're like you look at the
07:09,course and you're like Oh $300 for
07:11,John's how to mark yourself a software
07:12,developer course it's because look I get
07:14,emails from people every day they're
07:16,like I gotta hit this job making you
07:19,"know double six figures over $200,000 a"
07:21,year or I raise my hourly rate to 150
07:24,200 300 dollars an hour right it's
07:27,because that's what you can do in that
07:28,and now we just talking salaries here
07:30,we're talking hourly rates and
07:32,freelancing it goes way higher than that
07:34,and you know if you're talking director
07:36,and VP level positions which a lot of
07:38,developers or high-level architects
07:40,there's architecture tracks that a lot
07:42,of companies you can go up to there so
07:44,that's sort of that's my best estimates
07:48,you know you can disagree they're going
07:51,to vary from region to region they're
07:52,going to vary from city the city
07:54,obviously but those are the kind of
07:56,things that I'd be shooting for you know
07:58,from what I know about salaries today go
08:01,to resources though and search them like
08:03,glass door you know figure out do you do
08:07,a little bit more background research to
08:08,figure out what ranges are if you're
08:10,going to mess up mess up on the high
08:12,side don't ever mess up on the low side
08:14,so shoot higher than what you think that
08:17,it might be right that it just makes
08:19,sense to me I mean if you shoot too high
08:21,you can always like you can always come
08:24,down and in and and in and like say that
08:28,you made a mistake or you can you can
08:30,come up with some kind of excuse but I
08:32,would yeah most people aim too low and
08:36,hit there there's there's less people
08:38,that aim too high and miss so don't do
08:40,that there's a story of
08:42,I think it's in 48 loads of lots of
08:43,power I was listening to that book even
08:46,though people don't like that but 48
08:49,laws of power by so it's anyway I think
08:52,there's story and he talked about
08:53,Christopher Columbus and Christopher
08:54,Columbus you know he basically whoops I
08:56,guess I screwed that up I ran out of
08:59,space on my my iPhone in stop recording
09:02,I figure out what the heck is taking up
09:03,all the space on here I only had two
09:04,videos recorded so luckily almost all of
09:08,this video was recorded but anyway I was
09:09,saying Christopher Columbus 40 logs
09:11,power anyway he basically asked to be
09:14,called like the Vice Admiral of the I
09:18,can't even remember what it was but he
09:19,made a lot of big ass gas for the ship
09:21,he had never actually really was a
09:23,captain of a ship before he asked for
09:25,like 10 percent of all the royalties
09:26,from the new world he didn't get that
09:28,but he got almost everything he asked
09:30,and and this guy was I mean he was just
09:33,super bold so anyway ask big that's all
09:36,I'm saying what that is ask big and yeah
09:39,I forgot how I ended this last time I
09:41,think I plugged my book and my how to
09:43,market yourself to soften up of course I
09:45,did that in a I'll tell you why because
09:46,if you want more info on this you can
09:49,check out soft skills software
09:51,developers life manual obviously I've
09:52,got you know some some chapters in there
09:54,and marking yourself and and the course
09:57,how to mark yourself as a software
09:59,developer which obviously is going to
10:01,help you to be able to because if you're
10:02,watching these videos you know you
10:05,definitely want to be aiming for the
10:07,six-figure range right you should be if
10:10,you're if you're if you've taken those
10:11,courses right if you're if you've
10:13,basically if you're marking yourself
10:15,you're building a blog if you're doing
10:16,all this stuff that I'm telling you to
10:18,market yourself to build a name for
10:19,yourself and specialty you should be
10:21,aiming for the six-figure range you want
10:23,to be one of those outlier developers
10:24,not not not the average developer now if
10:28,you're not doing anything that's not
10:30,just going to magically happen but if
10:32,you're following the device that I'm
10:33,giving you you should be able to qualify
10:35,for that that should be the minimum that
10:37,your client for it'll take some time we
10:39,also do some hard work to do that but
10:41,anyway that's why I'm telling you that
10:42,and that's why when people ask I don't
10:44,know if I already said this because they
10:45,recorded recording participate anyway
10:48,that's when people why I charge 300
10:50,bucks for the course is because hey you
10:54,should be able to get like
10:56,filled in 10x the money that you pay for
10:58,that course you should you should
10:59,honestly be able to 20x the money you
11:01,pay for that course if you apply what
11:03,you learn from there anyway I was also
11:06,going to say if you you know if you have
11:09,a success story if you've like doubled
11:10,or tripled your income or whatever it is
11:12,I email me at John at
11:13,simpleprogrammer.com
11:14,if you'd like to be interviewed you know
11:16,I can make that happen and then also if
11:18,you if you know someone that could
11:21,benefit from this advice the salary
11:24,range is definitely share the video and
11:25,if you like this video subscribe to
11:27,channel also if you if you email me at
11:30,John at subprogram calm and let me know
11:33,any success source that you have you
11:35,know I would be happy to to to to get
11:39,those those are always nice you know get
11:41,a get a couple every week or so but but
11:44,the bigger the success the better I
